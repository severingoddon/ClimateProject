## Climate logger

This repository contains all the essential code for logging climate data, including temperature, humidity, and pressure (specifically with BME688), 
and subsequently storing it in a Google Spreadsheet. The system also provides data visualization in the web browser. The codebase is organized into two modules, 
one for the BME688 sensor and another for the DHT22 sensor, providing flexibility for data logging based on the preferred sensor.
